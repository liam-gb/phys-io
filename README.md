# Phys.IO

Phys.IO is a proof of concept desktop app that transforms clinical shorthand notes into physiotherapy referral letters using local AI.

## Features

- **Privacy First**: All processing happens on your device via Ollama, so no internet connection is required after set up
- **Time Saving**: Converts shorthand into structured, professional correspondence
- **Clarifying**: Identifies information gaps and asks targeted questions
  
## Screenshots

Please note that the patient data here is *entirely fictional and generated by Claude*. The referral letter and clarifying questions in the screenshots are generated by a model running locally on my device, based on the fictional patient notes.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download)
2. Run Ollama and pull a compatible model:
   ```
   ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
   ```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phys.io.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd phys.io

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm start
```

## How It Works

1. Enter notes from a physiotherapy session into the app
2. Phys.IO converts them to a professional letter
3. AI identifies missing information and asks clarifying questions
4. Answer the questions to improve the output
5. Export the final letter as needed
