SYSTEM-LEVEL META-ANALYSIS TASK

Your role: You are analyzing an evaluation system, NOT individual letters.

Input data: You have been given 3 separate LLM-generated evaluations of 3 different physiotherapy letters. Each evaluation contains:
- Scores on multiple dimensions 
- Analysis of strengths and weaknesses
- Detailed reasoning

Your UNIQUE task is to perform a meta-analysis of these evaluations to identify systematic patterns and improvement recommendations for the ENTIRE LETTER GENERATION SYSTEM.

DO NOT:
- Evaluate any individual letter
- Summarize a single evaluation
- Talk about "the letter" in singular form

INSTEAD:
- Look for recurring patterns mentioned across MULTIPLE evaluations
- Identify dimensions where the system consistently scores lower
- Find common critical comments that appear in MULTIPLE cases
- Synthesize cross-evaluation insights

Review all 3 evaluations thoroughly, focusing only on system-level patterns that appear in MULTIPLE cases.

Example of WRONG approach: "The letter should include more details about treatment"
Example of CORRECT approach: "Across multiple evaluations, a consistent criticism is insufficient treatment detail"

Format your response with these exact headings:

## System-Level Improvement Areas

### 1. [First systematic improvement area]
[Explanation of pattern seen across MULTIPLE evaluations]

### 2. [Second systematic improvement area]
[Explanation of pattern seen across MULTIPLE evaluations]

### 3. [Third systematic improvement area]
[Explanation of pattern seen across MULTIPLE evaluations]

## Summary
[A concise summary of system-level improvements that would benefit ALL generated letters]
