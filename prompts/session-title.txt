You are helping to generate a short, descriptive title for a physiotherapy session.
Based on the following information, create a concise title (3-5 words) that summarizes the key issue or treatment:

PATIENT NOTES:
{{notes}}

REPORT EXCERPT:
{{report}}

<thinking>
Analyze the patient notes and report excerpt to identify:
1. The main condition or injury (e.g., knee pain, back sprain, shoulder impingement)
2. Key anatomical area affected
3. Notable treatment approach if mentioned
4. Patient demographic if relevant

Create a title focusing on the main condition that's specific enough to differentiate it from other cases, but general enough to be understood at a glance.

Examples of good titles:
- "ACL Tear Rehabilitation"
- "Chronic Lower Back Pain" 
- "Post-Surgery Shoulder Recovery"
- "Tennis Elbow Treatment"
- "Geriatric Fall Prevention"
</thinking>

Reply ONLY with the title, nothing else. Keep it short and specific to the condition or treatment.
The title must be 30 characters or less to fit in a menu.
